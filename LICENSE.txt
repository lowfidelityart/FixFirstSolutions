Fix First License Preamble
==========================

This project — including this site’s content, code, and structure — is shared by an independent sole trader (Fix First Solutions / ffs.work) in the spirit of creative independence, repair culture, and radical transparency.

We are not a corporation. We’re not here to hoard knowledge or trap people behind support tickets. We’re just one person trying to fix things properly and leave the ladder down.

This work is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPLv3), which means:

- You can copy it. Fork it. Remix it. Build something better.
- You can use it for commercial work. That’s fine.
- But if you run it as a **hosted service** — like a website or app — you have to make your source code available to users.

That’s not about control. That’s about keeping things **fixable** for everyone.

If you're a fellow sole trader, artist, or ethical dev: you're welcome to build on this.
If you're a VC trying to clone it and close it off: you're not the intended audience.

For exceptions, questions, or a plain-English explanation, use Google.
